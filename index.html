					<h1>The Intense Side</h1>
					<p>
						Discover my discipline, workout routine, and hardcore side of life.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="content-section">
					<h2>Fitness Regimen</h2>
					<p>
						My workout plan follows a dedicated Push Pull Legs split, training 6
						days a week with intensity and focus. This structured approach has
						helped me develop both physical strength and mental discipline that
						carries over into other aspects of my life. Beyond the physical
						benefits, working out serves as a crucial mental outlet for me,
						clearing my head and providing a valuable "daily reset" that helps
						maintain my overall well-being and focus.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="content-section">
					<h2>Technical Growth</h2>
					<p>
						All my free time around the house is dedicated to expanding my
						coding knowledge and skills. I have a deep interest in understanding
						how things work at a fundamental level, which drives my passion for
						technology and programming. This curiosity keeps me constantly
						learning and exploring new concepts.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="content-section">
					<h2>Structured Discipline</h2>
					<p>
						I believe in maintaining a highly structured schedule to maximize
						productivity. My approach involves tracking progress at multiple
						levels: daily tasks feed into weekly goals, which support monthly
						objectives, creating a clear path toward my long-term vision. This
						systematic planning helps me stay focused and accountable.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="content-section">
					<h2>Future Vision</h2>
					<p>
						My structured planning extends up to 6 months ahead, with everything
						building toward my ultimate goal of launching my own app/web
						development company after completing university. This clear
						direction gives purpose to my intense work ethic and continuous
						self-improvement.

					<h1>The Social Side</h1>
					<p>
						Get to know my personality, friends, and the lighter aspects of my
						life.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="content-section">
					<h2>Adventure & Exploration</h2>
					<p>
						As an adventure and nature enthusiast, I'm always seeking new
						experiences in the outdoors. I have a strong appreciation for
						aesthetics, whether it's dressing up for a night out or discovering
						hidden gems during my favorite activity—bar and café hopping around
						Singapore.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="content-section">
					<h2>Sports & Recreation</h2>
					<p>
						Sports play a significant role in my social life. I regularly play
						basketball with friends and enjoy socializing over golf at the
						driving range while working on my swing. Currently, I'm in the
						process of establishing my golf handicap, and you can usually find
						me at ranges at the east of Singapore during weekends.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="content-section">
					<h2>Meaningful Connections</h2>
					<p>
						What I value most about my social connections is the opportunity to
						truly listen and understand people. I take genuine interest in
						hearing about others' achievements and challenges, believing that
						these conversations create the most meaningful relationships.
